### 			Computer Science Principle 2020 Term 1 Assignment 3 

Goal:

    1.	To be able to create basic data structure (array) using JavaScript and manipulate the data structure by adding/deleting/update data stored in it.
    2.	To consolidate the skill of  DOM manipulation using jQuery and HTML.
    3.	To practice function creation and function invocation.

Requirements:

​    In this assignment you are about to use the assignment3_basecode as a step stone  to build a system that follows your customer's demands: (40%)

1. adding more properties to the student object. Gender, cell phone number and year of enrollment should be recorded. 
   Age property should be replaced by DoB (Date of Birth) property. for instance:
   
   | studentId | name  | gender | DoB        | phone       | yearOfEnrollmet |
   | --------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
   | 1000      | Alice | F      | 2001-01-01 | 18012341234 | 2017            |
   | 1001      | Tim   | M      | 1996-01-01 | 15612341234 | 2014            |
   | 1002      | Robin | M      | 1999-01-01 | 18012341222 | 2015            |
   
   done

   3. list students whose phone number start with '180'
   4. list all the alumni (assume all student graduate 3 year after enrollments )

3. adding two charts to show visualize statistic data: 

    1. enrollment stats which use x-axis to describe the year of enrollment and y-axis to describe the mount of students enrolled
    2. alumni stats which use x-axis to describe the year of graduation and y-axis to describe the mount of students graduated

4. adding a login page to simulate the authentication procedure and once the user logged in, the main area should display Hi username!

​	sole: response to customer demands 1 and 2

​	team: response to customer demand 1, 2  and 4 plus one chart in 3

You have to clearly document your work by adding comments to your code so I can catch the intention of your code easily. If you finish the work
with a peer, you will also need to submit a text file describing the part you focused on.
